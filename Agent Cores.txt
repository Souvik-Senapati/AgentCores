7.3 Distributed Transaction Coordination
Purpose: Provides ACID guarantees across distributed systems with advanced compensation patterns.
text
Transaction Management:
  Technology Stack: Apache Seata + Temporal + Custom Transaction Coordinators
  
  ACID Guarantees:
    Two-Phase Commit (2PC):
      - Coordinator-participant protocol with timeout handling
      - Prepare phase with resource locking and rollback preparation
      - Commit phase with atomic completion across all participants
      - Recovery procedures for coordinator and participant failures
      - Performance optimization with parallel prepare operations
    
    Saga Pattern:
      - Choreography-based sagas with event-driven coordination
      - Orchestration-based sagas with centralized coordination
      - Compensation logic with automatic rollback sequences
      - Long-running transaction support with checkpoints
      - Timeout handling with customizable policies
    
    Event Sourcing:
      - Immutable event log with append-only operations
      - Event replay for state reconstruction and debugging
      - Snapshot generation for performance optimization
      - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) support
      - Multi-version concurrency control with optimistic locking


Consistency Models:
  Technology Stack: Apache Cassandra + CockroachDB + etcd + Custom Consistency Protocols
  
  Strong Consistency:
    - Linearizability with global ordering guarantees
    - Sequential consistency with program order preservation
    - Causal consistency with happens-before relationships
    - Monotonic read consistency with session guarantees
    - Read-your-writes consistency with client-centric views
  
  Eventual Consistency:
    - Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for automatic merge
    - Vector clocks for causal ordering in distributed systems
    - Last-writer-wins with timestamp-based resolution
    - Application-specific conflict resolution with custom logic
    - Quorum-based consistency with tunable parameters
  
  Hybrid Approaches:
    - Multi-level consistency with different guarantees per operation
    - Consistency regions with boundary enforcement
    - Adaptive consistency based on network conditions
    - Client-specified consistency levels with SLA guarantees
    - Consistency monitoring with violation detection


Compensation & Recovery:
  Technology Stack: Temporal + Apache Airflow + Custom Workflow Engines
  
  Advanced Compensation:
    Automatic Compensation:
      - Dependency graph analysis for compensation ordering
      - Idempotent compensation operations with duplicate detection
      - Partial failure handling with selective compensation
      - Timeout handling with escalation procedures
      - Resource cleanup with garbage collection
    
    Manual Intervention:
      - Human approval workflows with approval chains
      - Expert system integration for complex decisions
      - Escalation procedures with severity-based routing
      - Audit trails with complete decision history
      - Recovery point objectives with data protection
    
    Monitoring & Alerting:
      - Transaction health monitoring with real-time dashboards
      - Performance metrics with latency and throughput tracking
      - Failure analysis with root cause identification
      - Capacity planning with resource utilization forecasting
      - SLA monitoring with breach detection and alerting
